Lexical Analysis:
 - New Identifier (Variable)
1. Add size to the stack alloc
2. Set the offset to the stack in the Symbol in the symbol table for the variable

Generating code:

- PNT_ASSIGN
1. Look at the pointer to the Symbol in the symbol table from arg0
2. Take the offset to the top of the stack
3. Generate mov instruction to target that offset, with src arg1
4. Return pointer to the Symbol

- PNT_MUL
1. Create a new variable in the symbol table, add to the stack alloc
2. Generate mul instruction for the new variable
3. Return pointer to new Symbol variable in symbol table
